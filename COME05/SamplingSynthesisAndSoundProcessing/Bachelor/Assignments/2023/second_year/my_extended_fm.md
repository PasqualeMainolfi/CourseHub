| **Description** | The aim of this project is to experiment. Specifically, you are required to implement and customize an extended model of FM synthesis, choosing between DFM, NFM, and CFM. You will observe its behavior and evaluate the results obtained. The student(s) must perform thorough tests of the proposed model. They should record audio examples and compare the results with reference sound objects in order to assess the quality and expressiveness of the model |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Simulate the writing of a scientific article on the implemented model, the modifications made, and the results achieved. The article will follow a standard structure and include: Introduction: Presenting the project context and objectives; Detailed description of the implemented synthesis model, the modifications made to the initial model, and the parameters involved during the experimentation phase; Results presentation: Providing an overview of the obtained results; Critical analysis of the results and observations made during the design phase; Conclusions: Summarizing the main findings and discussing potential future developments or improvements |
