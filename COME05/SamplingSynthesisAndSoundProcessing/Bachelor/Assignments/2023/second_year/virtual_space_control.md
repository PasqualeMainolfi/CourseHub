| **Description** | The goal is to develop a script in CSound and/or Python for real-time control of an N-channel spatialization model using VBAP or DBAP techniques. The project should focus on implementing an interactive system where the user can choose the arrangement of speakers and have the ability to control the position, intensity, and movement speed of sound objects within the virtual space |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Connect an intuitive user interface to the control system, designed and implemented using tools like PyQt or Tkinter in Python |
