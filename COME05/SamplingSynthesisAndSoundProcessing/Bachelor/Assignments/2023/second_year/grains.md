| **Description** | The objective of this project is to define in CSound or Python a system for generating and controlling a granular synthesis model that can be applied to both synthetic and sampled sounds. The implementation should allow for controlling the relevant (and studied) synthesis parameters such as amplitude, waveform type, envelope, grain density, duration, spatial placement, etc... |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implement a real-time granulation model that can be applied to an input signal, such as voice or a musical instrument |
