Specifically, students will: choose a topic covered during the course that piques their interest. The topic can be related to a theoretical aspect, a practical application, or a specific case study; conduct in-depth research on the chosen topic, gathering information from reliable sources such as books, scientific articles, conferences, or specialized websites; follow a standard structure for the scientific article (provided by the instructor), including an introduction to the topic, a literature review, a description of the research methods used, the results obtained, a critical analysis of the results, conclusions, and possible future developments; write the scientific article using clear and concise language. It will be important to cite sources correctly and provide sufficient details to reproduce the research or understand key steps; revise and edit the article to ensure coherence, clarity, and accuracy of the content |
