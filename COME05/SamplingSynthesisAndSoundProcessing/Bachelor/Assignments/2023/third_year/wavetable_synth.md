| **Description** | The objective of this project is to build an audio synthesizer that implements the wavetable synthesis technique using CSound or Python. The synthesizer should be able to work with both synthetic and sampled waveforms. It is recommended to carefully choose the most suitable interpolation function. Furthermore, it is required to implement the option to choose the transition model, among the proposed ones (at least 3), for transitioning from one table to another |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implementation of an intuitive user interface in Python (Tkinter or PyQt) that allows controlling synthesis parameters |
