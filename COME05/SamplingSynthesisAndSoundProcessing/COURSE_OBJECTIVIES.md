# **Sampling Synthesis and Digital Sound Processing (COME/05)**  

Welcome to the "*Sampling, Synthesis, and Digital Sound Processing*" courses!  
This repository contains all the necessary resources for the course, including lecture notes, assignments, and additional materials.

**Course Objectives**  
The course objectives aim to provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in the field of sampling, synthesis, and digital sound processing, as well as the ability to use programming languages to implement audio algorithms and develop practical projects in the field of digital audio. Students will acquire theoretical and practical tools to conduct detailed analysis of audio signals, enabling them to deeply understand the acoustic characteristics of sounds. They will learn to develop scientific communication skills through the study of relevant articles and will be encouraged to write documents to present and share the results of their research.  
Furthermore, the course will offer students an in-depth overview of the potentials and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of digital audio. Students will gain knowledge about neural networks and machine learning techniques applied to audio synthesis and manipulation. They will be guided in exploring the multiple applications of AI in sound art and scientific research.  
Through practical projects, students will have the opportunity to experiment with and demonstrate the application of AI techniques in the field of digital audio. They will be encouraged to develop innovative artistic projects that leverage the potentials of AI. At the same time, they will be encouraged to conduct scientific research in the field of digital audio, applying AI techniques for advanced analysis, source separation, or the generation of new algorithms.  
This approach to integrating artificial intelligence in the field of digital audio will provide students with a comprehensive and practical perspective on the challenges and opportunities offered by AI.
