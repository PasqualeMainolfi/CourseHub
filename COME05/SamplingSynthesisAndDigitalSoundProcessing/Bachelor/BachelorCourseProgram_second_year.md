|**Duration of the course**|30h  |
|**Study hours**           |150h |
|**CFA**                   |5    |
|**Exam**                  |Exam. The exam will consist of the evaluation and discussion of a project chosen by the student from a series of projects proposed by the instructor, which have different levels of difficulty. The student will be required to present the chosen project, providing a detailed description of their work, the methodologies used, and the results obtained. During this phase, the evaluation committee will have the opportunity to ask questions and request further clarifications about the project. The evaluation of the project will be conducted based on predefined criteria, such as the originality of the work, the depth of analysis, the quality of implementation, and the correctness of the results obtained. The evaluation committee will also consider the student's ability to explain and defend their work in a clear and convincing manner. Finally, based on the evaluation of the project and the discussion, the committee will formulate a final judgment on the exam. The merits of the work done, the ability to understand and apply the theoretical concepts learned during the course, as well as the ability to present and communicate ideas and reasoning effectively, will be taken into account. It should be emphasized that the exam will be conducted rigorously, objectively, and impartially, with the aim of evaluating the skills and abilities acquired by the student. |
