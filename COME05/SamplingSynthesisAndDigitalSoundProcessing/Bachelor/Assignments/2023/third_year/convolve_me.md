| **Description** | The objective of this project is experimentation! The goal is to modify and customize a convolution algorithm in the Python environment in order to adapt it to the specific requirements of a desired target result, such as analysis, simulation, filtering, performance enhancement, etc... |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Simulate the writing of a scientific article on the implemented model, the modifications made, and the results achieved. The article will follow a standard structure and include an introduction to the project's context and objectives, a detailed description of the implemented model, the modifications made to the initial model, and the parameters involved during the experimental phase, a presentation of the results, a critical analysis of the results, observations during the design phase, and finally, the conclusions |
