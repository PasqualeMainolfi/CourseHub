# **FAQ**  

1. *What study materials is recommended for the course?*

   A: You can simply search for the course code you will be attending on the main page [README](/README.md) under the *Courses* section and click on SYLLABUS. Here you will find all the information.

   A: You are required to complete at least 70% of the total hours scheduled for your course.

4. *How will students be evaluated at the end of the course?*

   A: It depends. You can find this information in your study plan by checking if the course is associated with an "exam" or "elegibility" label. You will then find all the evaluation details in the SYLLABUS tab on the main page [(README)](/README.md).

5. *What are the dates and times for the exam sessions?*

   A: Unless there are exceptional circumstances, exam sessions are always held during the last week of each month. The instructor decides when to schedule the exams throughout the year. Once the date is set and the examining board is appointed, the instructor will inform you unofficially, while the official communication will come from the administration. It is mandatory to book the exam through the dedicated online service.

6. *What should I do if I have a justified absence during a lecture or exam?*

9. *What is the procedure to request a thesis with me as the supervisor?*

   A: You can find all the information under the *Thesis: Procedures and Guidelines* section on the main page [(README)](/README.md).

10. *What are the selection criteria for students who want to pursue a thesis with me?*

    A: What I strongly consider when selecting students who request to do their thesis with me is that the proposed work is closely related to my field of expertise. It is essential that students undertake research within my field of specialization, as this allows me to provide them with the guidance, support, and experience needed throughout the thesis process. It is crucial that their thesis proposal reflects an understanding and application of the concepts, theories, and practical skills covered in my courses. This coherence ensures a cohesive and meaningful learning experience for both the student and me as the supervisor.  
    I also place particular emphasis on experimental work, where students take risks and actively seek to bring about significant changes. Specifically, I encourage students to explore new ideas, methods, and innovative approaches in their thesis work. I believe that experimentation provides valuable opportunities for students to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and develop practical skills. It is through this process that students can cultivate their creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, experimental work offers the opportunity to actively contribute to the advancement of the field of study and make a significant impact within the discipline.  
    Lastly, time. A thesis requires an adequate amount of time, and I don't believe that approaching things hastily is the best approach.
