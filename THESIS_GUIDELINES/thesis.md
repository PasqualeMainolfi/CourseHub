## **Thesis: Procedures and Guidelines**  


> **Compilation or Curriculum Thesis (Bachelor and Master)**  

Presentation and discussion of a synthesis work resulting from a thorough analysis of a substantial collection of sources and bibliography. Specifically, it should be a work that summarizes the studies already conducted on the agreed-upon topic with the instructor in a reasonable timeframe (minimum 3 months, maximum 6 months), presented in a coherent manner through proper analysis, leading to a logical and personal re-elaboration of the subject matter.

The work should contain at least:  
- 30 pages for the three-year program
- 80 pages for the two-year program

The recommended structure for the work is as follows:  
- Title page
- Dedication (optional)
- Table of contents
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusions
- Appendices or attachments (optional)
- Bibliography
- Acknowledgments (optional)

> **Research or Empirical Thesis (Bachelor and Master)**  

The research thesis requires significant study and research on the agreed-upon topic with the instructor within a reasonable timeframe (minimum 6 months), aiming to provide a new perspective or highlight original and innovative aspects. A research work must also include a compilation and theoretical part, demonstrating personal considerations and elaborations resulting from the analysis of sources. The student bears the main responsibility for coordinating and conducting the research. It should be noted that the conducted research does not necessarily have to yield innovative results but can confirm or enrich original research conducted nationally and internationally within the subject area.

Structure of the work:  
- Title page
- Dedication (optional)
- Table of contents
- Introduction and study objectives
- Body, consisting of hypotheses, existing studies, new studies, results, and reflections. An example of the body of the work could be:  
   - Chapter I: Defining the hypothesis to be confirmed or disproven after conducting the necessary tests and investigations  
   - Chapters II and III: Detailed presentation of the research, discussing the methodologies used, how they were applied, and the outcomes  
   - Chapters IV and V: Presentation of the research results, indicating whether the initial hypothesis was confirmed or refuted  
 - Bibliography
 - Appendix
 - Acknowledgments (optional)
