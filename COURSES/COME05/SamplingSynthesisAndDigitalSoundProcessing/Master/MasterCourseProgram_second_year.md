|**Evaluation**                  |Exam. Checking out and talking about a project chosen by the student and approved by the teacher, based on the stuff we've been learning in class. The project will be assessed based on specific criteria, such as originality, depth of analysis, implementation quality, and correctness of the results. At the end of the evaluation, the student will receive a judgment of eligibility or non-eligibility. The assessment will consider the quality of the work, the student's understanding and application of the theoretical concepts learned in the course. It's important to note that the exam will be conducted rigorously, objectively, and impartially, solely for the purpose of evaluating the student's acquired skills and abilities.|
