|**Duration of the course**|30h  |
|**Study hours**           |150h |
|**CFA**                   |4    |
|**Prerequisites**         |Bachelor Degree<br>An intermediate knowledge of the Python programming language is required, including: understanding of data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets; comprehension of control structures like if-else statements, for and while loops; ability to handle file input/output (I/O); string manipulation skills; implementation of lambda functions; and understanding of object-oriented programming concepts such as class creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, an intermediate knowledge of the CSound programming language for sound synthesis is required, including familiarity with key audio programming elements: advanced syntax, structures for event control and generation, integration with other tools, utilization of MIDI and OSC protocols, and optimization practices. Regarding academic background, a strong understanding of mathematical and physics principles covered in a high school curriculum, such as algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, is necessary.|
|**Evaluation**                  |Eligibility test. Checking out a project picked by the student and agreed upon with the teacher based on the topics covered in the course. The project assessment will consider factors such as originality, depth of analysis, quality of implementation, and accuracy of results. Based on this evaluation, a judgment of eligibility or non-eligibility will be determined for the student. The assessment will also take into account the student's ability to understand and apply the theoretical concepts covered in the course. It's important to note that the test will be conducted fairly and objectively, solely aimed at evaluating the student's skills and abilities.|
