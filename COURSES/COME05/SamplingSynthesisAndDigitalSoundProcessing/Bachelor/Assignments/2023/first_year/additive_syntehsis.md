| **Description** | The objective is to develop a complex sound event generator in CSound using the technique of additive synthesis. The amplitude and frequency of each component must be automatically calculated through a documented and implemented procedure. Each sound event should be applied with an envelope function |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | The user should be able to choose the number of components and the type of relationship between them, possibly selecting from a set of proposed solutions. Additionally, it is possible to write a Python script that allows for the automation of event generation and/or synthesis parameter manipulation |
