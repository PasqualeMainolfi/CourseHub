| **Description** | The goal is to develop a synthesizer, using CSound or Python, capable of generating complex sounds using subtractive synthesis. The user should have the option to choose the type of source signal to apply harmonic subtraction to, and be able to control synthesis parameters such as amplitude, frequency, envelope, control signal types, and filter characteristics using a real-time MIDI controller |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implement a graphical interface (using Cabbage Studio or Python) that allows the operator to interactively control synthesis parameters and provides visual feedback |
