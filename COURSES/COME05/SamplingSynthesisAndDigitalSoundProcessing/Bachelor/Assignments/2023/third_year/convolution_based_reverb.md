| **Description** | The objective of this project is to implement a convolution algorithm in Python without using any methods or functions from the numpy or scipy library. However, it is allowed to use the numba compiler. The algorithm should be written from scratch and used to apply impulse responses provided by the instructor to an input signal, such as a voice or a musical instrument. The impulse responses provided by the instructor should be imported into the code so that the operator can choose which one to apply |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Optimize and improve the performance of the algorithm by using techniques such as fast convolution (FFT-based) or other advanced methods |
