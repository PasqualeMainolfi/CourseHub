## **Getting Started**  

### **Homebrew (only for MacOS)**  

---
What is Homebrew? Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that allows you to easily install, update, and manage software packages and dependencies. It provides a convenient way to install command-line tools, libraries, and applications on your macOS system. With Homebrew, you can quickly install software packages that are not included in the default macOS installation, keeping your system clean and organized. It also helps manage dependencies between different software packages, ensuring that they work together seamlessly.

...if you have MacOS, first install *Homebrew* (<https://brew.sh/index_it>)

1. Open the terminal
2. Paste the following command and press <Enter>:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### **Conda**  

---
What is a Virtual Environment Manager? A virtual environment manager, like Conda, helps you create isolated environments with specific software versions and dependencies. This ensures that your course projects and assignments run consistently and independently of your system's global software configurations.

By using Conda, you can create a dedicated environment for the "Course Name" course, install the required packages, and manage their versions separately from other projects or courses you may be working on.

If you're new to Conda, here's a quick guide to get started:

1. Install Conda
    - by following the official documentation for your operating system: <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#>.
    - or, open the terminal and install conda via brew:  

    ```shell
    brew install --cask miniconda
    ```

2. Create a new Conda environment for the "Course Name" course

```shell
conda activate
conda create -n [env_name] python=<VERSION.X>
```

3. Activate the created environment to start working on the course materials: `conda activate course-environment`.
4. Install additional course-specific packages and dependencies.

```shell
conda activate [env_name]

pip install numpy matplotlib pandas pyaudio librosa mido python-rtmidi python-osc
```  

On MacOS you may need to install:  

```shell
brew install ffmpeg
brew install pkg-config
brew install portmidi
brew install portaudio
...
```

### **Python**  

---  
Python is a versatile and popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and offers a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python is a high-level language, which means it provides abstractions that simplify the process of developing applications. It has a vast standard library and a thriving ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.  
We will install Python in the virtual environment created via Conda.  

```shell
conda activate
conda create -n [env_name] python=3.10
conda activate [env_name]
pip install numpy ffmpeg flask
```

However, it is also possible to install Python on the main system

- from the webpage <https://www.python.org/>
- via `brew` (on MacOS)  

  ```shell
  brew update
  brew install python@<VERSION.X>
  ```  

  check your installation by running  

  ```shell
  python -version
  ```

### **Rust**  

---  
Rust is a programming language known for its strong focus on safety and performance. It was created by Mozilla Research and is used to develop a wide range of applications, from system programming to game engines. One of the most distinctive features of Rust is its ownership system, which prevents common memory access errors, ensuring that code is robust and secure. Additionally, Rust provides precise control over system resources, allowing developers to write highly efficient code. Thanks to these features, Rust has become increasingly popular among developers looking for a reliable programming language to tackle complex challenges in the world of software development.  

Rust installation:  

- you can find all information about at: <https://www.rust-lang.org/>  
- on Mac or Unix-like  

  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

  check your installation by running:

  ```sh
  rustc --version
  ```  

  for more information see: <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/>  
- on Windows and other, see: <https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html>  

### **Java**  

---
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is widely used for building robust and scalable applications, ranging from desktop and mobile applications to enterprise systems and web applications. One of the key features of Java is its platform independence, which means that Java programs can run on any operating system or device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java a popular choice for developing cross-platform applications.  
Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" principle, allowing developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms without the need for major modifications. This is achieved through the use of bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate representation of the Java code, which is executed by the JVM.  
Java provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks, making it easier for developers to build complex applications. It supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks, and provides built-in memory management through garbage collection.  

Java installation:  

- you can find all information about at <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html>  
- via `brew` (on MacOS)  

  ```shell
  brew update 
  brew install java
  ```  

  check your installation by running:  

  ```shell
  java -version
  ```

### **CSound and Cabbage Studio**

**IMPORTANT NOTES**  
If you have downloaded and installed Python from the official website, it is crucial to remember to add Python to the system PATH during the installation process. Adding Python to the system PATH allows the operating system to recognize the "python" command from any location on your computer. This is particularly important when you need to run Python scripts from a terminal window or command prompt. During the Python installation process, you may come across an option to "Add Python to PATH" or a similar choice. Make sure to select this option to enable access to Python from any location.
