|**Evaluation**            |Exam/Elegibility test. Everybody will have to complete two written tests (transcriptions of excerpts from sheet music) throughout the entire duration of the lessons. Specifically, one test will be halfway through the course, and another at the end of the course. Since it's a mixed course, students will need to check the evaluation method stated in the curriculum: elegibility or exam? Elegibility test: each test will be evaluated on a scale of thirty/30. Students will pass if they achieve an average score of 18/30 or higher. Exam: in addition to the two tests, there will be a brief interview during the examination, where the committee will assess the ability to understand and apply the theoretical concepts learned during the course. Each test (two written tests and the interview) will be evaluated on a scale of ten/10. Students will pass the examination if they accumulate a score of 18/30 or higher. It should be emphasized that the test will be conducted strictly, objectively, and impartially to evaluate the skills and abilities acquired by the student.|
