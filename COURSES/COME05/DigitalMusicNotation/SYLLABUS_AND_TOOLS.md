[**⬅️ BACK HOME**](/HOME.md)  

Welcome to the "*Digital Music Notation*" course!  

> **Course Objectives**  

The digital music notation course is all about teaching you the skills to write and transcribe music using advanced digital notation software. Our main goal is to give you a deep understanding of music writing principles and techniques using digital tools.  
Throughout the course, you'll learn how to use professional notation software that can create high-quality scores. We'll start with the basics of music notation and show you how to accurately and legibly represent them using the software.  
You'll gain a thorough understanding of the rules and conventions of music writing, including formatting, multiple voices, chords, dynamics, and articulations. You'll be able to create different types of scores and instrument combinations, considering technical specifications and stylistic contexts.  
We'll provide practical examples and exercises to help you apply what you've learned. You'll be guided in transcribing existing musical pieces, including melodies, harmonies, and instrumental parts.  
By the end of the course, you'll be proficient in using at least one professional digital notation software. You'll have a deep knowledge of music writing rules and regulations, and you'll have developed technical skills to create accurate and readable scores.

> **Educational method**  

The adopted teaching method follows a rigorous structure that includes a theoretical component and a laboratory component. The theoretical part of the lessons is dedicated to a clear and systematic exposition of the fundamental concepts of the subject. Through detailed explanations, relevant examples, and visual illustrations, the aim is to provide students with a deep understanding of the theoretical principles underlying the discipline.  
The laboratory part, on the other hand, constitutes an essential element for consolidating the acquired theoretical knowledge. During these sessions, students have the opportunity to directly apply what they have learned by tackling concrete problems and developing practical skills. Through interactive activities, programming exercises, practical projects, and simulations, students gain familiarity with operational procedures and develop the necessary skills to independently solve problems.
