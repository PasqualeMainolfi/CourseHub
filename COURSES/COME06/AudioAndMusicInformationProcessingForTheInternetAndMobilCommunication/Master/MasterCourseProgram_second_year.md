|**Evaluation**            |üáÆüáπ Idoneit√†. Valutazione di un progetto di verifica scelto e realizzato dall'allievo, previamente concordato con il docente, sugli argomenti trattati durante il corso. La valutazione del progetto sar√† condotta in base a criteri predefiniti, quali l'originalit√† del lavoro, la profondit√† dell'analisi, la qualit√† dell'implementazione e la correttezza dei risultati ottenuti. Infine, basandosi sulla valutazione del progetto si formuler√† un giudizio di idoneit√† o non idoneit√† dello studente. Saranno considerati i meriti del lavoro svolto, la capacit√† di comprendere e applicare i concetti teorici appresi durante il corso. Si sottolinea che il test sar√† condotto in modo rigoroso, obiettivo e imparziale, al fine di valutare le competenze e le abilit√† acquisite dallo studente.<br><br>üá¨üáß Elegibility test. Evaluation of a student-selected and implemented verification project, previously agreed upon with the instructor, on the topics covered during the course. The project assessment will consider factors such as originality, depth of analysis, quality of implementation, and accuracy of results. Based on this evaluation, a judgment of eligibility or non-eligibility will be determined for the student. The assessment will also take into account the student's ability to understand and apply the theoretical concepts covered in the course. It's important to note that the test will be conducted fairly and objectively, solely aimed at evaluating the student's skills and abilities.|
