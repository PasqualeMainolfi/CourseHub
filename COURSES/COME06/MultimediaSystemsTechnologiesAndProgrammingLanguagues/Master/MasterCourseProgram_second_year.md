|**Evaluation**            |Exam. Evaluation and discussion of a student-selected and implemented verification project, previously agreed upon with the instructor, on the topics covered during the course. The proposals will have different levels of difficulty and will require the application of specific knowledge and skills acquired during the course. The project will be assessed based on specific criteria, such as originality, depth of analysis, implementation quality, and correctness of the results. At the end of the evaluation, the student will receive a judgment of eligibility or non-eligibility. The assessment will consider the quality of the work, the student's understanding and application of the theoretical concepts learned in the course. It's important to note that the exam will be conducted rigorously, objectively, and impartially, solely for the purpose of evaluating the student's acquired skills and abilities.|
|**Notes**                 |Given the need to work with sensors, soldering, and other related hardware aspects, this course will have a close collaboration with the Electroacoustics course COME/04. The collaboration will provide students with the opportunity to integrate sound and audio elements into their multimedia projects, thereby enriching the overall experience and enhancing the interdisciplinarity of the course. Joint sessions or workshops will be conducted, allowing students from both courses to collaborate, share knowledge, and explore the integration of sensors, audio components, and other electroacoustic elements in their multimedia works.|
