| **Description** | The purpose of this project will be to attempt to solve a non-existent problem.<br>You will start by designing a certain scenario of any nature where bidirectional OSC (and/or MIDI) communication must be present.<br>At this point, it will be your task to articulate and structure a non-existent problem that blocks or makes the communication inefficient.<br>The game will consist of designing a procedure to solve the problem and restore or make the communication efficient.<br>Keep in mind that the problem does not necessarily have to be something that prevents machines from communicating, but it could also be, for example, a data optimization problem, etc.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
