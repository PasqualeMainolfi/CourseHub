| **Description** | Development of a MIDI-OSC Converter in the Python/Csound environment.<br>Implement a converter capable of translating MIDI messages into OSC messages, enabling communication between multiple devices.<br>The architecture of the converter should include: a module for MIDI message handling, a parsing module, a module for converting messages into OSC messages, and a module for sending messages.<br>The parser should read received MIDI messages and interpret them correctly. The parser should be able to differentiate between different types of MIDI messages, extract parameter values associated with them, and create a suitable data structure for subsequent conversion into OSC messages.<br>The conversion module (which implements the parser) should convert MIDI messages into OSC messages.<br>The sending module should allow sending a message to a specified address.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
