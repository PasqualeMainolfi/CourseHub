| **Description** | Develop a work, whether it is an animation, an installation, or a simple visual composition, in Java-Processing, using the OSC protocol for the control and generation of sound events in the CSound environment.<br>Java-Processing will act as the client, while CSound will function as the server. It is important to note that the communication will be from the Java-Processing client to the CSound server, and not vice versa.<br>Imagine it as a game where a player has the ability to create a customized visual work. The player should be able to select both the visual elements, such as shapes and colors, and the type of sound events and their duration. Once the selections are made, the player should confirm their choices and, by clicking a specific button, allow the work to come to life.<br>There are no specific rules to follow regarding the logic of the visual elements' evolution. Implementing a simple random process would be sufficient.<br>At the end, the screen should return to the initial page, ready for another gaming experience.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implement an intuitive UI.|
