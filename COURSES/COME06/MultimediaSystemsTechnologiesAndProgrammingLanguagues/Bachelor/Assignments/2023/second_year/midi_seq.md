| **Description** | Using the specific libraries for MIDI protocol management in Python or Java-Processing, develop a comprehensive program that allows users to control a virtual synthesizer using an external MIDI controller.<br>The program should display the connected MIDI devices on the screen and prompt the user to select the desired device. In case any issues arise, the program should ask the user to check the connection and reconnect the device if necessary.<br>The user should be able to choose from a selection of available instruments (at least three) and be able to modify the generation parameters in real-time using the controller.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implement the ability to record the performance as an audio file and save it as a MIDI file.<br>Implement a simple and intuitive user interface.|
