| **Description** | Design and implement a visual pattern generator using Java-Processing or p5.js. The goal is to create an interactive application where users can adjust parameters to modify the type and appearance of the pattern. The user should be able to interact with the application using the mouse or keyboard to adjust pattern parameters. They should be able to modify the number, shape, and color of the elements that make up the pattern. Additionally, whenever users adjust the parameters, the pattern should update in real-time to reflect the changes made. |
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Implement an option, selectable by the user, that, when enabled, generates random patterns without direct user intervention.|
