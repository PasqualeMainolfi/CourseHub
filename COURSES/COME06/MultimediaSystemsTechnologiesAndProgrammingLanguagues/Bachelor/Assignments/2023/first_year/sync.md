| **Description** | Design and implementation of a simple visual art piece. The artwork should include the generation of synchronized sounds with the visual elements. The objective is to combine graphical elements and sounds to create a multisensory experience. Implement a variety of visual elements such as geometric shapes, lines, points, or images. Utilize random generation algorithms or more complex algorithms for generating patterns and visual structures. Utilize a sound synthesis library in Processing (such as Sound, Minim, or Beads) to generate real-time events. Synchronize the generated sound events with the visual elements in such a way that sound and animations influence each other.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Real-time control of audio-visual generation parameters.|
