| **Description** | Develop a simple game called "Catch the Circle". The objective of the game is to collect as many falling circles as possible while avoiding them from hitting the ground.<br>Game Rules:<br>At the beginning of the game, a character (represented by a rectangle or any shape other than a circle) will be positioned at the bottom of the screen. Colored circles will start falling randomly from the top of the screen. The character should be controllable using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move left and right. The character should be able to make contact with the circles to "collect" them. Each time a circle collides with the character, the score increases by one (the score should be displayed on the screen). If the character misses a circle and it falls to the ground, one life should be deducted. The falling speed of the circles should gradually increase. The character should have a limited number of lives (for example, 3 lives). When all lives are exhausted, the game should end, displaying the final score on the screen.|
| **Presentation** | It is essential and mandatory to produce documentation in the form of slides, covering the entire development process, decisions, implementation choices, and achieved results. It is also mandatory to provide detailed documentation explaining the functioning of the control system, including limitations and technical aspects |
| **Bonus score** | Associate sound events to different types of collisions (collection and hitting the ground), score increments, life decrements, etc.|
